# Like Counter for Videos

## Description:
The "Like Counter for Videos" plugin allows users to give "likes" to embedded videos on a WordPress page. By double-tapping a video, a like heart will be displayed, and the like count will increase. Likes are stored locally for each video, and the heart disappears after a 500 mls.
